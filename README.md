## Description
The web application allows users to create an account and leave reviews for games, with the ability to add a game to the site if there are no existing reviews for it.

Below are some features of the site:
- Authentication for reviewers, to ensure quality of reviews
- Game Search
- Display of most popular games (WIP)

## Directions for Future Development
- Continue to add more games to the database & encourage users to add potential games (potentially API link to our database?) 
- Have a faster vetting system for user game submissions.
- Add functionality for users to recover lost accounts (email/sms codes). 
- Compress game cover art images to decrease load speeds.
- Build a bigger forum extension for games that allow for users to add walkthroughs etc (integration with YouTube API).
- Work with online retailers to link games over for purchasing (If possible).

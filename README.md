## Description
This web application allows users to look up games and their reviews, alongside writing their own reviews for their favourite games. Users must create an account before being able to leave reviews for games. Furthermore, users have the ability to add a game to the site if it currently does not exist in our database.

Below is our defined User Story:

```md
AS A gamer who wants to look up game reviews, 
I WANT to be able to view a list of games, see a brief description and honest user reviews,
SO I CAN decide whether I want to invest time and money into that game. 

```

The diagram below illustrates our database layout:

## Development
Our main goal was to build a full stack application that helps users find reviews on games they may want to try out. 
We wanted to fill a gap in the market between a Reddit forum page and an IGN game review site.
<br>

`Minimum Viable Product - Users to add game reviews to their favourite games!`


## Future
Due to the time constraints given for completion of this project, we had to scale back a lot of potential features. Moving foward, we would like to add some of these features in the future. 

1. Continue to add more games to the database & encourage users to add potential games. Looking at potentially linking an API to our database, so we can store all existing games (e.g. from Steam) in our database. 
2. Have a faster vetting system for user new game submissions.
3. Create admin accounts with special access (e.g. to delete game information from the application, add pictures for games). 
4. Functionality for users to recover lost accounts (through using email - npm package `nodemailer`). 
5. Compress game cover art images to decrease load speeds.
6. Build a bigger forum extension for games that allow for users to add other features such as video walkthroughs (integration with YouTube API).
7. Work with online retailers to link games over for purchasing.
